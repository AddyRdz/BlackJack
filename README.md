# Blackjack

## Game Overview

I followed the typical Blackjack game formula, but I did not implement a hold button. Basically a player will press a button to be fed a card, and a player can ask for as many cards as they like but they must be careful not to go over 21 in value. If a player goes over 21 they have lost the game and the dealer wins. In this version of Blackjack you are going against the dealer.
