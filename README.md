# Blackjack

## Game Overview

I followed the typical Blackjack game formula, but I did not implement a hold button. Basically a player will press a button to be fed a card, and a player can ask for as many cards as they like but they must be careful not to go over 21 in value. If a player goes over 21 they have lost the game and the dealer wins. In this version of Blackjack you are going against the dealer. 

## User Stories

* As a user, I will press the Hit Me button and receive a card.

* As a user, I will proceed to press the Hit Me Button until I decide to stop.

* As a user, I will win a game by reaching the number 21.

* As a user, when a winner I will see a message of "Blackjack Winner" when winning the game.

* As a user, I will lose if I go over 21.

* As a user, when a loser I will see a message of "Loser, try again!" when losing the game.

* As a user, I will be able to press the Reset button to play again.
